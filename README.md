# CISC 372 - Assignment 2

One common issue faced by e-commerce platforms is to tag appropriate labels with images of products so that they pop out when queried. 

Naturally, human annotation is arduous, and very costly in terms of hours needed, and never-ending (new products are released all the time!). 

The goal of the assignment is to create a classifier that can identify the label of a fashion product image using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and iteratively improve the model.

The images can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small).

Attached is a ```train.csv```, and ```test.csv``` file. These will be used to setup the train and test dataset.
